The file solar_metric_clock.ino contains the source code for the Arduino solar metric clock I built.
The code I run on my clock is actually managed by the Arduino IDE on my laptop and not synced to this
github repository, though I can move changes back and forth manually. I've posted this version for
friends who want to update their clocks' code without my manual intervention.

In order to use this code, you need to set several constants: Local DST rules for your location, your
timezone, your wifi SSID and password and your longitude. Search the code for the string "XXX SET" to
find the places where those constants are defined. I have organized the code into blocks corresponding
to the modules it relies on, and the constants are defined the blocks for their respective modules.

You'll need these libraries installed in your Arduino IDE in order to build and upload the binary to
your clock:

WifiNINA_Generic: https://github.com/khoih-prog/WiFiNINA_Generic
Adafruit GFX: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library
Adafruit LED Backpack: https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_LED_Backpack
TimeLib: https://playground.arduino.cc/Code/Time/
DS3231 real-time clock: https://github.com/NorthernWidget/DS3231
Timezone_Generic: https://github.com/khoih-prog/Timezone_Generic

Most of those should be installable directly from the Libraries tab on the right-hand side of the
Arduino IDE. Some may have dependencies and pull in other libraries -- it's so long ago that I installed
them that I don't remember.

The one that isn't managed nicely by the Libraries tab is the Timezone_Generic library. You need to
download and install that version from a .zip file. Navigate to this page

https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v1/tutorials/installing-libraries

and scroll down about halfway for instructions on doing that. Some additional hints here:

I use the on-laptop version of the Arduino IDE, not the cloud version, so these instructions may be
peculiar to my installation. Let me know if you have trouble or questions.

If you do make improvements, I'd welcome a note or pull request!
